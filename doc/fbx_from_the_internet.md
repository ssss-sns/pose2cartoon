### Step1 Environment Preparation 
*It is more recommeneded to use linux to configure your maya and mayapy*

* Install maya. For linux, refer to [autodesk tutorial](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/zh-hans/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/simplecontent/content/installing-maya-2020-ubuntu.html)
* When maya is installed successfully, you can find *mayapy* at `/usr/autodesk/maya/bin/maypy`, you can use absolute path / alias / env variable to let your system find mayapy
* To test mayapy, you can try to run all the `import` commands in `maya_save_fbx.py`

### Step2 Dataset / 3D Model Preparation 
Download fbx model from the internet, you can use the links 
* [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) (recommended)
* [cgtrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/human)
* [turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free/human/fbx)

You need to ensure the downloaded fbx model is T-posed by default 

### Step3 Run the fbx parser
Run in the terminal 
`mayapy fbx_parser.py sample.fbx`

If the parsing is successful, you will see generated files like follows: 
- sample.txt -> riginfo 
- smaple.obj -> T-posed mesh
- sample.fbm -> texture information 

You may see some error / warning info in the console's logging, but you can ignore them if expected files are all genereated. 

### Example 
For the matching of 3d model with texture, an example is shown as follows: 

![posed_texture](../img/posed_texture.png)

### Others
* For fbx downloaded from the internet, parsed riginfo(.txt) may contain illegal characters for mayapy to parse. In such cases, you need to clean the `txt` manually
For example, for models downloaded from mixamo, remove `mixamo::` in the riginfo file. 
* You may find triangles of the mesh in `obj` does not cover the whole surface of the 3d model, and in such cases, you can manually add triangles, e.g. utilizing `open3d`
